# Lab Session Three

> These documents are my working notes for each of our weekly sessions. Think of them as a Cliff's Notes version of Kubernetes the Hard Way with some of my own commentary. If we find anything substantive in our sessions, we'll be sure to open and link Pull Requests against the KTHW source of truth on Github.
